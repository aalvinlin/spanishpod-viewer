# Spanishpod Viewer

## Introduction

This project allows for easier viewing of downloaded Spanishpod101 files.

Directory contents are listed and lessons can be browsed via links.

Audio files can be clicked to play in the browser.

## Usage

The application assumes that all files are in a directory called "files".

The "files" directory should contain subdirectories for each language level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, etc.).

Within each level directory should be subdirectories, each for an entire seasons' worth of lessons.
